## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) which is a moderately saturated blue, represented as hex code #4788D8, for a trustworthy and professional feel.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) which is a very light blue/grey, represented as hex code #F0F4F8, to ensure legibility and contrast.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 50%, 40%) which is a slightly desaturated cyan color, represented as hex code #30A1A1, to highlight calls to action or interactive elements without overpowering the main color scheme.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clean and modern readability throughout the portfolio.
- Use a consistent style of icons (e.g., outline icons) to represent project categories and technologies used.
- Implement a grid-based layout for project display, ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- Subtle animations on project hover or click to provide visual feedback and enhance user engagement.
